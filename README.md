omegaOsgEarth
=============

Module for osgEarth in omegalib

## Building Instruction on Linux / Windows
No dependencies needed. 

## Building Instruction on  Mac OSX
You will need [HomeBrew](http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/).

After HomeBrew is installed, run:
```shell
brew install boost pcre proj
```

## Troubleshooting
If running the basic example `examples/chicago_flat.py` does not display a planar map of the Windy City, the osgEarth plugins have not been found or have failed loading. You can set the environment variable `OSG_NOTIFY_LEVEL=DEBUG` and run the example again to get detailed information on the plugin loading process.

### (Linux) Loading fails with message ERROR 6: Unable to load PROJ.4 library
This happens if you already have a PROJ.4 installed on your system and the version is incompatible with the use used by omegaOsgEarth. You can force omegaOsgEarth to load its internal PROJ.4 library by setting the `PROJSO` environment variable. For instance, in a bash shell or in .bashrc:
```
export PROJSO=<path to omegalib build>/bin/libproj.so
```
